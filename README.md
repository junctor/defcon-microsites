# DEF CON Microsites

[![Deploy Microsites](https://github.com/junctor/defcon-microsites/actions/workflows/pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/junctor/defcon-microsites/actions/workflows/pages.yml)

This repo hosts standalone microsites designed to supplement the official DEF CON schedule at [info.defcon.org](https://info.defcon.org).

These microsites are built with **Vite**, **Preact**, and **TypeScript**, and are optimized for fast display on conference screens or mobile devices. Each microsite is statically hosted and backed by live Firestore data.
